# BRAN2020-intake-catalog
A simple intake catalog for BRAN2020 data at NCI in Australia.  This catalog should assist with data discovery and loading into the Australian Research Environment(ARE) and other "Pangeo"-style workflows making the data more "analysis ready".

BRAN is a key output of the Bluelink partnership: a collaboration between the Australian Department of Defence, Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO.  The data is freely available to the public through NCI.
